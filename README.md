# ImageUpscale

This repository implements ESRGAN (Wang et al., 2018), a state-of-the-art deep learning model for single-image super-resolution. It uses a Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) architecture without batch normalization, combined with a perceptual loss and adversarial training to achieve realistic textures.
